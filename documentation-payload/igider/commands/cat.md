# 📖 `cat` Command – File Content Reader

The `cat` command reads and returns the **contents of a file** from the remote system. It is commonly used during post-exploitation for data gathering, configuration review, and credential harvesting.

## 🧾 Arguments

| Argument | Type     | Description                        | Required |
|----------|----------|------------------------------------|----------|
| `path`   | `string` | Absolute or relative path to file  | ✅ Yes   |

---

## 💻 Usage Examples

```bash
cat /etc/passwd
cat ../notes.txt
cat ./secrets.txt
```

- Relative paths are resolved from the current working directory of the agent.
- Binary or large files may not be handled well — intended for **text-based files**.

---

## 🔁 Behavior

- Uses Python's built-in `open()` in read mode.
- Joins all lines into a single string and returns the output.
- Path resolution is handled automatically:
  - If `path` is relative, it’s joined with the agent's current directory.
  - If `path` is absolute, it’s used directly.
